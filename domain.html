It provides facts how to increase team performance with the help of team diversity. The performance of diverse teams increase as the size of the action space gets larger, and also that diverse teams converge faster than uniform teams. Therefore team diversity is important forming teams. This is basically based on the notion of spreading tail and non-spreading tail agents and they allow making many predictions about teams as the action

                                                <p>The world is evolving and emerging in the hub of a wave of revolutions, spanning from massive changes in global business to the ever-exploding presence of information technology. As businesses get bigger day by day, the complexity is also getting higher. New trends are being incorporated with business ecosystems. Customer behavior is changing, new technologies are evolving rapidly in a dynamic nature and it has significant influence in the organizational processes. So each and every day, small to large scale companies need to update themselves in- terms of resources, assets, manpower, capital and infrastructures in order to maintain a competent and healthy business ecosystem.</p>
                                                <p>It is a known and proven fact that there is a need of information-driven culture in a company in order to cater the needs of customers in today’s world. For achieving this, they need a tool or service to discover and prioritize business challenges across their organization with these new assessment methodologies and bring information closer to them so that they can make wiser decision.</p>
                                                <p>Choosing the right individual for the right job can change the outcome of a lot of factors in a company aimed towards the effectiveness and good productivity. Each individual should be grouped or assigned to work depending on their performance to get the maximum benefit. If an individual is not best suited in their designated line of work, he/she should be transferred to a team which can take the most use out of those individuals’ knowledge and expertise. When the minority of a particular team has the most knowledge of a particular subject, the knowledge will not be equally divided within the team.

                                                    </br></br>When a knowledge person resigns, the company will have to spend time, effort and cost on grooming a new candidate. For the best interests of the company, this particular occurrence should be reduced as well. Nowadays, a lot of apparel and IT companies spend a huge cost on consultation in order to resolve the above mentioned factors. It takes a lot of time and effort for a human to judge an employee’s skill and talent. This needs to be addressed as well. Therefore the purpose of this research is to address such mentioned issues.

                                                <p>Hence, knowing more about business and knowing it relevantly faster than others is the best way to gain an edge on business competition. For this there is need of a Business Intelligent tool which can cater the need of today’s world. Companies have understood the importance of enforcing achievements of the goals defined by their business strategies through business intelligence concepts.</p>
                                                <p>
                                                    There are commercially available BI tools but below are the drawbacks.
                                                    <ul>
                                                        <li>They are far too expensive which are being developed by big vendors and often target to big client.</li>
                                                        <li>Small and medium scale companies neither can afford cost nor can hire any Business Analyst in order to analyses and predict the behavior, patterns and trends of their business.</li>
                                                    </ul>
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    It has been found that $150 000 is the average cost of business intelligence software for ETL software (Extract transform and load) which is far too expensive for a small and medium scale companies .And the rule of thumb for cost of effort and services is five times the software 
                                                    Considering the above facts, we can come to a point that there is a real need of cost-effective Business Intelligent(BI) tools that can cater the need of today’s business ecosystem addressing the need of all types of companies ranging from small scale to higher scale.

                                                <p>This section includes detailed descriptions about the techniques and mechanism employed to make People Clues a reality. The descriptions include how software implementation of our project is carried out, what are the materials and data needed, and how they will be collected. It also includes time frames and schedules that are required in achieving its objectives. In addition to them, the research areas that we have identified in order to carry out this project are explained rationally.</p>
                                                <p>In this research we have focused on implementing two arms of People Clues application.</br>
                                                    1.	<strong>Desktop Application</strong></br>
                                                    This includes core components of People Clues which are automated ETL tool, predictive model building and evaluation. These components will be displayed using controls in the main user interface.</br>
                                                    2.	<strong>Web Application</strong></br>
                                                    This includes another core component which is People Clues dashboard. It is used for visualization of data. It gives you an idea about the overall system in a glance.</br></br>
                                                    Data in a business can be very useful if and only if analyzed properly which leads to take strategic business decisions. It is acceptable that the data can be in various formats and locations. Thus People Clues should be able to extract data automatically in whatever form it is available.</br></br>
                                                    The user can select only required attributes to analyses the data hence People Clues will only consume the selected attributes and precede for predictive analysis. Furthermore People Clues will automatically detects odd data and remove it from processing. Hence it will result in high- accuracy and best quality output. We only focused on HR systems, Finance systems, Project tracking systems as data sources.</br>
